Input .vcf should have human seqs, nean seqs, deni seqs in this order.
Usage:
g++ -o read main.cpp

Case 1: human being distinct
./read (.vcf) (case#) (output file name)
e.g.: ./read aligned.vcf 1 output
Case 2: human same with Nean but different with Deni
./read (.vcf) (case#) (# of human seqs) (# of nean seqs) (# of devi seqs) (output file name)
e.g.: ./read aligned.vcf 2 1 6 4 output
Case 3: human same with deni but different with nean
./read (.vcf) (case#) (# of human seqs) (# of nean seqs) (# of devi seqs) (output file name)
e.g.: ./read aligned.vcf 3 1 6 4 output

Output style:
Tags of human, nean, devi, followed by position, followed by REF->ALT.
